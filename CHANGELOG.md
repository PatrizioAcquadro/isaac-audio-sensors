# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Strengthened `AudioSensorFrame` as the public v1 frame contract with
  `schema_version`, `frame_name`, `Pose3D` array/source poses, explicit units,
  provenance, time-window fields, and deterministic `max_events` semantics.
- Added JSON Schema export, tracked schema and trace examples, trace
  round-trip helpers, and JSONL frame writer support.
- Added lifecycle-capable `IsaacAudioArraySensor` updates for repeated stage
  snapshots, moving source/array metadata, active sound windows, latest-frame
  access, structured debug primitives, and package writer integration.
- Expanded the Omniverse extension wrapper with configure/start/stop/update
  and latest-frame export entry points.
- Renamed the bundled config and Isaac Sim example away from legacy project
  phase naming.
- Documented the 0.1.x API freeze with stable, provisional, experimental, and
  internal/private surfaces after the Isaac-native Sim/Lab upgrades.
- Added public release-candidate docs for versioning, archive auditing,
  completed roadmap items, live Isaac validation expectations, and API-change
  deprecation policy.
- Added a distribution audit script and `make audit-dist`; `make build` now
  checks the built source distribution and wheel for required public files,
  forbidden generated/private paths, and public-package leak tokens.
- Kept the package version at `0.1.0`; the current hardening remains part of
  the initial release-candidate surface, while the frame contract stays
  `ias.audio_sensor_frame.v1`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-21

- Added the standalone `isaac-audio-sensors` package with pure core models,
  geometry-only simulation, synthetic TDOA simulation, optional room-acoustics
  simulation, CLI trace export, lazy Isaac Sim helpers, lazy Isaac Lab wrappers,
  generic examples, public documentation, and validation tests.
- Documented the initial 0.1.x public API freeze and semantic versioning policy.
- Excluded project-specific adapters, generated media, private recordings, and
  local environment artifacts from the public package boundary.
